            <h1>About</h1>
                <p>
                    I’m a programmer with a non-traditional software engineering background. I graduated with a BS in Economics 
                    from University of Havana in Cuba, my program included Programming, Algebra, Calculus, Optimization, and Databases. 
                    These courses molded my analytical process and problem-solving skills setting up the foundations for a future career 
                    in software development, something I didn't think of at the moment. I work and think like a scientist, meticulous 
                    and detailed oriented, but still, I never contemplated myself pursuing a career as a developer, partly because I 
                    thought coding was an elite profession for top talented people with special abilities.<br>
                    <br>
                    Reading inspiring stories about people like me, without a Computer Science degree or any clue about how to code 
                    became software engineers were truly encouraging, and then I came to understand that there aren’t any “special” 
                    requirements to becoming a software developer, that I only needed to be willing to work hard, be tenacious, 
                    dedicated to learning and more importantly, being consistent.<br>
                    <br>
                    So having that already on my side I decided to join the FreeCodeCamp.org community where I learned the basics of 
                    programming using Python and JavaScript. Free resources like the MIT 6.006 course Introduction to Algorithms, helped 
                    me to start with Data Structures and Algorithms. I always have loved Math and solving puzzles so I joined and I’m still 
                    active in competitive programming platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and CodeSignal.<br>
                    <br>
                    Having the basics, the passion, and the excitement to continue learning, I got into the Hack Reactor Bootcamp in the 
                    Advanced Software Engineering Immersive Program, where I learned and developed several projects with cutting-edge technologies 
                    like full-stack JavaScript, React, ES6, Node.js, SQL and NoSQL databases, Blockchain, and computer science fundamentals. 
                    Worked in Agile software development environments handling tools like Jira, GitHub, and Circle CI, dedicating myself completely 
                    to learn more every day and become a better programmer.<br>
                    <br>
                    To dig deeper into Data Structures and Algorithms so I completed a DS&A Nanodegree on Udacity, taught with Python, 
                    and have been working on personal projects using Python frameworks until today.<br>
                    <br>
                    Complementing my technical abilities, I also possess stellar interpersonal and communication skills in English and Spanish, 
                    with an impressive ability to foster positive relationships with others (I’m super sociable) and to lead cross-functional teams.
